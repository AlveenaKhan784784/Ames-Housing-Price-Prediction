# Objectives
**Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and important features that affect house prices.
**Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance and select the most relevant features.
**Modeling**: Apply and compare various machine learning algorithms to predict house prices. 

# Project Benefits
**Insightful Findings**: Understand which factors have the most significant impact on house prices.
**Practical Application**: Build predictive models that can be used for real estate market analysis and valuation.
**Educational Value**: Demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.
